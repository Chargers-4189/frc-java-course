# Welcome to Lesson 0.0 - Example

## Preface

> The purpose of this new curriculum is to have students 1. Apply their knowledge to the build season and 2. Be exposed to some level of FRC experience. This is so that students are prepared and can actively participate in discussions and their projects.<br />
> This new form of teaching aims to help provoke discussions and problem-solving before the teacher introduces the material. It follows the EFFL teaching method, Experience First, Formalize Later. It's a student-centered approach where learners actively engage with the concepts and discuss them with real-world examples.<br />
> Why is this approach? There are several benefits to this approach, mainly, increased engagement, better understanding, improved problem-solving, and enhanced collaboration. This teaching approach will not only help students learn the material but also teach them how to collaborate and develop critical thinking skills that can be used in the FRC competition.

We'll start small to build the foundations. Then move onto more complex and advanced concepts.

> ## Learning Objectives
>
> - Understand the components of a machine/robot
> - Understand the difference between declarative and imperative paradigms
> - Understand the 2 main components of Command-Based Design in machines
>   - Commands
>   - Buttons
>
> ### Success Criteria
>
> - I can explain the different important parts of a machine
> - I can explain the difference between declarative and imperative paradigms
> - I can explain what a Command and Button do in the design

# Pizza Party From Vending Machines

Your class sees students getting snacks from the vending machine at school every minute and wonders if they could fix the broken one for a class pizza party. Your teacher asks the school, and they agree to fund it if you can program the outdated vending machine to work. The issue is that the vending machine is old and malfunctioning, requiring a rework of the code.

1. Explain a 3 step process of how a simple vending machine works?
   <br />Example response:

   ```
   Step 1: A student enters a certain amount of coins.
   Step 2: A student uses the buttons to select a snack.
   Step 3: The vending machine dispenses the snack.
   ```

2. What are the inputs to this vending machine?
   <br />Example response:
   ```
   Coins & student selection
   ```
3. What are the outputs to this vending machine?
   <br />Example response:
   ```
   Snack & change
   ```

Upon analysis, the old vending machine only has these parts working, which you can program and interact with:

- Coin collection & counter mechanism
- Snack selection panel with five rows and three columns
- Snack dispenser mechanism for each of the 15 snacks

Before we start programming, let's design and structure how we want to build this program. First, let's choose a paradigm (or style) of programming:

- A **Declarative Paradigm** is what a program should do based on the condition. This targets the desired task, not how to do it (e.g.step by step).
- An **Imperative Paradigm** is when we declare what happens in a program. This runs the program step by step, the order of steps is crucial to function. (You're used to this approach)

4. What paradigm would we use if we want our program to work on vending machines that have different grid sizes?
   <br />Example response:
   ```
   Most vending machines need to specify a row and column to dispense a snack. A declarative paradigm would directly satisfy the outcome of selecting snack at row X and column Y without needing to detail the steps.
   ```

We'll use the declarative paradigm and then compare it with an imperative paradigm later. Now let's do some psuedocode.

5. What do you think the function `dispenseItem(X, Y)` does?
   <br />Example response:

   ```
   Dispense the snack at row X and column Y.
   ```

6. How do you think the vending machine knows when to dispense the specified snacks? What conditions?
   <br />Example response:

   ```
   When the payment of the snack is satisfied and the student enters the selection.
   ```

7. What are the buttons on the number pad used for?
   <br />Example response:

   ```
   For students to enter the row and column the snack is located at.
   ```

   > Discuss with the class how buttons send commands to the vending machines processing center
   > Discuss how different actions and buttons can affect what commands are related to the behavior of the vending machine.

8. What other commands could the vending machine perform?
   <br />Example response:
   ```
   1. CalculateTotalAmount() - Check the money inserted by a student
   2. ReturnChange(amount) - Return change if the amount paid is higher than due
   3. SelectItem(itemNumber) - Selects a specific snack based on selection
   ```

# Quick Summary

## Definitions:

- **Commands** - Instructions that a robot can follow to perform. In robots, they represent the actions the robot can take.
- **Buttons** - Physical or virtual elements that triggers specific commands. In robots, they are operator controls that send signals to the robot (commands) to do tasks.
- **Declarative paradigm** - Specifies the desired outcome or result, rather than specific steps to achieve it. You declare _what_ you want the program to do, no _how_ to do it.
